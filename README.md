# Project Abstract
A Point-of-Sale System (PoS) is a computer system where the customer makes payment for goods or services that are offered 
by your company. It is widely used in the restaurant industries, making restaurateurs and employees much easier in 
sending orders to the kitchen staff and improving the workflow. It is also capable of tracking restaurant inventory as 
well as showing how the restaurant is performing over a specific period of time. The servers can easily create an order 
ticket through the main computer and send it to each designated station allowing the kitchen staff to work efficiently.

# Below are some main features for this program: 
- Add items to customer's order. 
- Delete items from customer's order. 
- Update quantities 
- Take customer's payment. 
- Create a ticket for the customerâ€™s order and send the information to the kitchen printers or tablets. 
- Show which menu items have the best conversion rates (best-selling menu items). 
- Check the total sales at any specific date. 
- Void a specific ticket 
- Issuing refund on any order/individual items 
- Allow employees to clock-in
