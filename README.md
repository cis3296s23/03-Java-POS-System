# Point-of-Sale System (PoS)
A Point-of-Sale System (PoS) is a computer system where the customer makes payment for goods or services that are offered 
by your company. It is widely used in the restaurant industries, making restaurateurs and employees much easier in 
sending orders to the kitchen staff and improving the workflow. It is also capable of tracking restaurant inventory as 
well as showing how the restaurant is performing over a specific period of time. The servers can easily create an order 
ticket through the main computer and send it to each designated station allowing the kitchen staff to work efficiently.
