## Michael’s Persona:

**Name:** Peyton Sampson, 
**Age:** 40,
**Occupation:** Head Chef

Peyton is the head chef of the family-owned restaurant: Sampson’s Diner. After graduating from college with a degree in 
Culinary Arts, with the support provided by her two brothers and sister, the four of them formed the diner ten years ago. 
In that time, with a gradual increase in popularity, the diner also grew to hire numerous chefs, making for a very busy 
kitchen for Peyton. However, for the sake of increasing productivity, she welcomes the help now more than ever due to the 
sudden increase in customers. To maintain the satisfaction of these customers, she strives to both increase the kitchen’s
productivity and improve the restaurant’s menu with customer data.


To help with the sudden influx of customers, Peyton is currently seeking ways to help cater to them, which is how she 
found the Java POS System application. She currently suspects that her current system of estimating popular dishes with 
her notebook is very inefficient and imprecise. As head chef, she often does not have the time to write every dish, let
alone to manually sort through every order each day, so she normally opts towards using her memory to aid in this process.
As this is what she has used to improve the quality of the restaurant’s food thus far, she has had no problem with this 
method. However, to help free time and rely on more accurate data, the analytical data provided by our POS System, which 
includes a list of dishes sorted by popularity, is something she shows interest in.
